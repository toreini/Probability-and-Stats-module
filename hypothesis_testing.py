""" A common perception about COVID-19 is that Warm Climate is more resistant to the corona outbreak and we need to verify this using Hypothesis Testing. So what will our null and alternate hypothesis be?

Null Hypothesis: Temperature doesnâ€™t affect COV-19 Outbreak
Alternate Hypothesis: Temperature does affect COV-19 Outbreak
Note: We are considering Temperature below 24 as Cold Climate and above 24 as Hot Climate in our dataset.
