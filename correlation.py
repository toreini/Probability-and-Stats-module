# Their default values are suitable for getting the sample covariance matrix. 
# The upper-left element of the covariance matrix is the covariance of x and x, or the variance of x. 
# Similarly, the lower-right element is the covariance of y and y, or the variance of y. 

# Pandas Series have the method .cov() that you can use to calculate the covariance:
cov_xy = x__.cov(y__)
